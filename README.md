# COMPASS: Open-source Momentum Pointing Angular Stability Systemâ€‹

COMPASS is a reaction wheel system for a smallsat being developed by the Husky Satellite Lab, a CubeSat team at the University of Washington. It is intended to be portable to other reaction wheel systems using the pyramidal configuration, save for the specific hardware-software interfaces and certain libraries which are specific to the arduino system.
